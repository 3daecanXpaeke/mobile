Robert Lowie was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, in 1883. He moved to the United States with his family in 1893. He studied at the College of the City of New York and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University in 1908. He worked as an assistant curator at the American Museum of Natural History from 1909 to 1917, where he conducted fieldwork among various Native American groups. He then joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught until his retirement in 1950. He died in 1957.
 
Lowie was a student of Franz Boas, the founder of American anthropology. He followed Boas's approach of historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness and diversity of cultures and rejected any universal laws or stages of cultural evolution. Lowie also criticized the diffusionist school, which argued that cultural traits spread from a few centers of origin to other regions. He argued that diffusion was not a sufficient explanation for cultural similarities and differences, and that other factors, such as environmental adaptation, historical accident, and psychological factors, had to be taken into account.
 
Lowie was also interested in the functionalist school, which focused on the interrelations and functions of cultural elements within a society. He acknowledged the contributions of functionalists such as Bronislaw Malinowski and Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, but he also pointed out their limitations and biases. He argued that functionalism tended to neglect historical change and cultural variation, and that it often imposed artificial categories and concepts on the data. He advocated for a more flexible and holistic approach to ethnology, which combined historical, comparative, and functional methods.
